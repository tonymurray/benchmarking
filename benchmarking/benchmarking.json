This indicates that SSA\u2019s agricultural research spending (excl. private for-profit sector) has not kept pace with growth in agricultural output.

Severe fluctuations in yearly agricultural research funding in many countries compromise long-term budget, staffing, and planning decisions, all of which affect the continuity and outcomes of research. Agricultural research agencies, particularly in SSA\u2019s low-income countries, are more dependent on funding from donors and development banks than are their counterparts in other developing regions, and this type of funding has shown considerably greater volatility over the past decade compared with government funding.<\/p><p class='bm-indicator-about bm-subheader'>About the indicator<\/p>The volatility coefficient measures the volatility of agricultural research spending by applying the standard deviation formula to average one-year logarithmic growth of agricultural research spending over a certain period. Volatility coefficients were calculated based on complete time-series data on R&D spending (excl. private for-profit sector) for the 2000\/09\u20132014\/16 period (see notes in the indicator download for periods by country).

Overall, in 2016, an average of 57 percent of the funding to the national agricultural research institutes across SSA (excluding South Africa, and a number of the smaller countries) was provided by national governments, and funding from donors and development banks constituted 28 percent. Donor and development bank funding to agricultural research has been on the rise in recent years after prior contractions. The World Bank has been a major contributor to the institutional development of agricultural research in SSA in the form of country projects financed through loans and supplemented by grants.<\/p><p class='bm-indicator-about bm-subheader'>About the indicator<\/p><p>This indicator represents donor and development bank funding as a share of total agricultural research funding of the principal government and nonprofit agencies for which detailed cost category data were available. It comprises all salary, operating and program costs, and capital investments. Data are based on actual disbursements, not budgeted projections. Donor funding, by nature, is short-term and ad hoc; hence, the research agendas of countries with very high shares of donor funding can be skewed toward short-term goals that are not necessarily aligned with national or regional priorities.
